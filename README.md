# Welcome to ZIO Crew talks repository

## About us

ZIO Crew wants to build and spread beyond borders knowledge about `ZIO`, `Scala`, functional programming and its practical, real world applications.

We do this through building a community, building and sharing projects, and giving public talks on different aspects of technology and applications.

We collect, store, publish and PR all seminar, conference, meetup, etc talks in the same place to localize knowledge about ZIO, share it across developers and give a word of mouth about the best developers, who work on those projects.

Each talk consists of the following:
* Topic
* Author info and credentials
* PR with a related code
* Link to slides (if applicable)

All talks are recorded and published on our video channels
